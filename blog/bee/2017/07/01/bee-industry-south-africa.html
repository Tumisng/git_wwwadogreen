<h4 id="south-africas-automotive-industry-is-to-lobby-the-government-to-accept-its-planned-r35billion-transformation-fund-as-an-equity-equivalent-initiative-for-the-ownership-pillar-of-the-new-broad-based-black-economic-empowerment-bbbee-codes">South Africa’s automotive industry is to lobby the government to accept its planned R3.5billion transformation fund as an equity equivalent initiative for the ownership pillar of the new broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) codes.</h4>

<p>Nico Vermeulen, the director of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), the representative body of new vehicle manufacturers, said on Friday that the idea of establishing a sector code had been abandoned and the seven locally based original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would operate independently in terms of the generic BBBEE scorecard.</p>

<p>However, Vermeulen said these OEMs had a major challenge in regard to ownership, because they did not have any equity for sale as they were wholly-owned subsidiaries of global multinational companies.</p>

<p>“In that regard, the OEM venture capital (transformation) fund was formulated and is now the subject of discussion and negotiation with the Department of Trade and Industry (dti),” he said.</p>

<p>Jeff Nemeth, the former chief executive of the Ford Motor Company of South Africa and president of Ford sub-Saharan Africa, told Business Report in 2015 that multinationals did not like to dilute their brands and found the ownership pillar in the new codes “very onerous”.</p>

<p>Nemeth said most sector specific codes had been more onerous than the general codes and this was one of the issues the industry would have to work its way through.</p>

<p>The automotive industry executives announced last week that the seven OEMs in the country planned to create a transformation fund that would allocate funds to develop black ownership in the car industry supply chain and vehicle dealership network.</p>

<p>They also provided details of the industry-developed vision and master plan to 2035.</p>

<h2 id="mining-charter-iii-may-be-problematic">MINING CHARTER III MAY BE PROBLEMATIC</h2>

<h4 id="johannesburg---while-the-transformation-imperatives-in-the-governments-mining-charter-iii-which-was-gazetted-last-month-were-laudable-its-unintended-consequences-are-problematic">Johannesburg - While the transformation imperatives in the government’s Mining Charter III, which was gazetted last month, were laudable, its unintended consequences are problematic.</h4>

<p>Stelio Zakkas, the manager at Monitor Deloitte, on Wednesday unpacked the six compliance areas of the charter during a discussion on the strategic implications of it. It was hosted by legal experts from Deloitte and Webber Wentzel and held in Sandton, Johannesburg, yesterday.</p>

<p>He told the 186 member audience comprising mining executives that ownership, one of the six elements which had attracted the most controversy, was the need for right holders to have a 30percent plus one black person shareholding within a year.</p>

<p>The 30percent target is split between an 8percent for employees through share ownership schemes, 14percent for black entrepreneurs and 8percent for mining communities.</p>

<p>Read also:  Mining sector faces unrest and other woes</p>

<p>The shares issued to a community must be held in a “community trust”, which must be created and managed by the yet to be constituted Mining Transformation and Development Agency (MTDA).</p>

<p>Zakkas argued that the MTDA should be a non-profit company, which was established as a National Government Business Enterprise under the Public Finance Management Act, 1999.</p>

<p>“Depending on the rights accruing to the shares held by the community trusts, the assigning of control of a plethora of community trusts to the MTDA may result in a violation of the Competition Act, 1998,” Zakkas said.</p>

<p>“In our view, the MTDA patronisingly deprives communities of the ability to manage their asset for their own benefit and, in fact, contradicts Mining Charter III’s objective of “redressing historical, socio-economic inequalities and ensuring broad based and meaningful participation of black persons in the mining and minerals industry”, he said.</p>

<p>In terms of black empowerment entrepreneurs, “BEE entrepreneur” was defined as a black-owned company or a black person who acquires an equity interest in a holder through a BEE transaction.</p>

<p>“While this is a seemingly good development, in our experience, the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) does not view all ‘established’ black-owned companies as BEE entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>“Further, while this provision may have provided an efficient segue to the Department of Trade and Industry’s (dti) Black Industrialist Scheme, it is unclear if the DMR and dti have considered the possibility of jointly broaching this issue, leading to yet another instance of non-cohesive policy development,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="7-things-you-need-to-know-about-radical-economic-transformation">7 Things You Need To Know About Radical Economic Transformation</h2>

<h4 id="heres-what-the-ancs-policy-discussion-document-says-about-how-it-will-make-economic-transformation-a-reality">Here’s what the ANC’s policy discussion document says about how it will make economic transformation a reality.</h4>

<p>Radical economic transformation is “the gospel truth”, according to President Jacob Zuma. Both of the two main candidates touted to take over as ANC president – Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa – have also embraced the phrase.</p>

<p>What it means for policy and politics, however, is still up for grabs. Does it mean unprecedented overhaul of the economy or is it old policy cloaked in a new catchy slogan? Is it an empty “ideological smokescreen” for state capture, as suggested by authors of the Betrayal of the Promise report, or a visionary call-to-action?</p>

<p>Here are (simplified) key strategies from the ANC’s policy discussion document on how they plan to realise economic transformation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Re-industrialising South Africa’s economy</li>
</ol>

<p>The country must sever its old growth path, largely dependent on exporting raw materials. Instead, government must create the conditions for the economy to industrialise through manufacturing and beneficiation, or processing, of raw materials. It must use industrial policy - such as providing incentives for manufacturers - to promote a more diverse economy and generate mass employment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Emphasis on black ownership (of land and the economy)</li>
</ol>

<p>Priority must be given to generating black ownership in emerging new, and old, sectors of the economy including mining and manufacturing. Revised BEE codes also need to be enforced across a range of sectors.</p>

<p>Targeted financial support - such as tax breaks and improved market access - for black enterpreneurs and small businesses is listed as crucial for equitable growth.</p>

<p>Supporting land reform and “returning the land to our people”, along with investment in farming equipment and technical skills transfer to beneficiaries, is a priority policy intervention.</p>

<h4 id="the-anc-is-holding-its-fifth-national-policy-conference-in-nasrec-south-of-johannesburg">The ANC is holding its fifth national policy conference in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg.</h4>

<p>JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize says if the country doesn’t move to implement radical economic transformation, it risks losing its democracy.</p>

<p>Mkhize on Saturday addressed the business community and ANC members at the Progressive Business Forum’s breakfast.</p>

<p>The ANC is holding its fifth national policy conference in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Mkhize says the business community shouldn’t be spooked by radical economic transformation as it isn’t aimed at fighting the private sector.</p>

<p>“It has nothing to do with fighting the private sector. No, it’s about helping the private sector and saying that the future belongs to a much broader base.”</p>

<h4 id="radical-economic-transformation-is-in-essence-about-building-a-more-equal-society-through-sustained-inclusive-growth">Radical economic transformation is, in essence, about building a more equal society through sustained inclusive growth</h4>

<p>The ANC’s programme of radical economic transformation has its roots in the Freedom Charter, which was adopted at the Congress of the People in Kliptown 62 years ago this week.</p>

<p>The Freedom Charter captures perfectly the intent and, to some extent, the content of radical economic transformation. It was at the Congress of the People that representatives of the people of this country gathered to declare that: “The People Shall Share in the Country’s Wealth.”</p>

<p>Given the extent of dispossession, discrimination, exploitation and exclusion, this call in the Freedom Charter was a call for radical and fundamental economic transformation.</p>

<p>Over the intervening six decades, the principles of redress, redistribution, social justice and equality have been at the centre of ANC economic policy. These principles have underpinned the ANC’s policies in government, notably in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and the National Development Plan (NDP).</p>

<p>At the ANC’s Mangaung Conference in 2012, the organisation adopted the NDP as an overarching framework for the second phase of our democratic transition – the pursuit of socio-economic freedom. The Mangaung Conference recognised that in the nearly two decades since the advent of democracy, political freedom had largely been achieved. The priority now was to pursue economic freedom.</p>

<p>The workshop, convened by President Jacob Zuma, was aimed at scrutinising proposals to deal with the “systematic and structural implementation challenges” of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act and engage on the proposed recommendations to realise government’s ambitions on radical socioeconomic transformation.</p>

<p>Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies, briefing the media prior to the workshop, said the proposals intended to strengthen empowerment in South Africa, improve the participation of the marginalised and apply the lessons learnt form preceding initiatives.
While details of the various proposals have not yet been released, with the council still mulling its options and ways forward post the workshop, Davies indicated that the council would work towards implementing various initiatives after securing Cabinet approval.</p>

<p>Davies noted that it was not a deliberate, decision-making meeting, but rather to engage ideas and gather information resulting in a clearer path forward.
Four focus areas would be used to forge a way forward to enable further opportunities to develop higher levels of inclusivity.</p>

<p>Following the meeting, Davies said procurement as a driver of black business and transformation emerged as a strong theme, with general agreement that procurement needed to be more carefully considered and crafted, with some suggestions that another approach be adopted that expanded the participation of black business.</p>
