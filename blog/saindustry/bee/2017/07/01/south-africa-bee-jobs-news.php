<p>In a finding released in the institute’s latest South Africa Survey, it said this did not bode well for the economy because government would find it harder to expand the rollout of grants or to increase their value.</p>

<p>“The numbers are a recipe for social and political chaos,” the institute’s analyst Gerbrandt van Heerden said.</p>

<p>“As the economy stagnates, and tax revenue slows, demand for more grants will increase. The government will then have to cut other areas of expenditure in order to meet popular demands for more and higher grants. We predict that this will lead to much higher levels of violent protest action.”</p>

<h4 id="the-organisation-for-economic-co-operation-and-development-oecd-has-updated-its-data-on-the-average-wage-paid-to-workers-across-the-36-countries-it-covers">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has updated its data on the average wage paid to workers across the 36 countries it covers.</h4>

<p>The latest jobs data by StatsSA showed a quarter -on-quarter increase of 0.8% in average monthly earnings paid to employees in the formal non-agricultural sector to R18,687 in February 2017.</p>

<p>BankservAfrica’s Disposable Salary Index (BDSI) showed a more realistic ‘take home’ picture averaging at R13,790 in May 2017, slightly lower than April’s R13,914.</p>

<p>The OECD data uses the total wages paid out to employees, hence the Stats SA data makes for the best comparison. It should also be noted that the OECD is also adjusted for purchasing power parity.</p>

<p>Jobs data by StatsSA for 2016 showed that average monthly earnings paid to employees in the formal non-agricultural sector was at R17,517 per month – translating to R210,200 annually.</p>

<p>South Africa’s average salary per year translates to $15,861, but the country has a local purchasing power almost twice the value of the US$ – a fair value exchange of R5.81 to the dollar, according to the IMF (2016).</p>

<p>Compared to the most recently available OECD data, South Africa falls somewhere in the middle of the country’s covered, with the dollar equivalent (US$36,180, adjusted for purchasing power parity) placing around the same levels as Italy and Spain.</p>

Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane bulldozed through a 30% BEE requirement with seemingly little consultation from the industry itself. The result has been a plunge in mining shares and further distress for the sector. But in a country where BEE is firmly on the agenda, what is the best way to tackle it. In this article, Sara Gon of the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), proposes a system of “economic empowerment for the disadvantaged” or EED. It’s an interesting idea that chiefly makes inclusive growth a key priority. – Gareth van Zyl</h4>

<p>Two recent but disparate events bring Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) into sharp focus.</p>

<p>The first is the new Mining Charter, the second, the predicament of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in light of its leadership crisis.</p>

<p>Sara Gon is a Policy Fellow at the IRR, a think tank that promotes economic and political liberty
There are multitudinous criticisms of BEE: it benefits only a small elite, it has progressed from voluntary compliance to obligatory quotas, its processes are complex, and it has failed to take account of the impact of economic and financial realities on its implementation.</p>

<p>For the first time, the mining industry is staring down a politically compromised and dishonest minister in Mosebenzi Zwane.</p>

<p>“This charter’s not going to see the light of day anytime soon,” says mining law expert Peter Leon. “We’re looking at years of protracted litigation.” (‘Zwane’s controversial mining charter won’t see light of day’ – analyst, Paul Burkhardt and Kevin Crowley, BizNews, June 19, 2017).</p>

<p>In the same article, Ben Davis of Librium Capital Limited says: “The value destruction is hard to quantify and the uncertainty will persist. What is certain is that South Africa continues to be a terrible destination for mining investment and assets in South Africa will continue to trade at a discount”.</p>

<p>In a letter to Business Day on June 20, 2017, John Louw asks incredulously how a charter can force mining companies to pay dividends over a 10-year period to facilitate the repayment of finance extended to empowerment “partners”, with a penalty if the dividends fall short of extinguishing such debt at the end of the period? This imposition on a listed company is contrary to the most elementary principles of capital management. Dividends should only be declared and paid by the directors of a company after due consideration of numerous factors, not least of which are ongoing liquidity and solvency.</p>

<p>Carol Paton points out (By Playing two sides, Malusi Gigaba takes a gamble on the economy’s strength, Business Day, June 20, 2017) that it was no coincidence that at his press conference on 15 June, 2017, Gigaba promised imminent policy certainty through inter alia the Mining Charter.</p>
