                <h2 id="is-renewable-energy-a-solution-to-zambias-energy-deficit">Is renewable energy a solution to Zambia’s energy deficit?</h2>

<p>Zambia currently faces a huge energy deficit although the country boats of huge potential to explore alternative sources such as renewable energy to meet the gap.
Zambia’s power deficit is estimated at 560 megawatts and the country is now relying on the importation of power to cushion the electricity shortage that has hit the country substantially.</p>

<p>ZESCO Limited, Zambia’s biggest power provider is projected to suffer a revenue loss of about of US$227 million as a result of the deficit. Other alternatives such as construction of hydro plants take long to complete and are long term measures to nip the energy shortage in the bud.</p>

<p>With the challenges elaborated above, Zambia must now look at renewable sources of energy to resolve the shortage of energy. The government, private sector and other stakeholders are now looking at ways of resolving the energy deficit in Zambia.</p>

<h2 id="zambias-president-faces-tough-choices-ahead-of-august-election">Zambia’s president faces tough choices ahead of August election</h2>

<p>A shrinking economy, violent escalations, and a possible IMF bailout have put Zambia’s President Lungu in a difficult position ahead of the August 2016 general election. Having to make a number of difficult decisions in the coming months, he risks triggering more public frustrations and violent outbursts.</p>

<p>April started brightly for Zambia with news that Zambia’s currency, the kwacha, has gone from the world’s third-worst performance in 2015 to the best this year as copper prices recovered. However, the positive mood has quickly turned sour.</p>

<p>First there was the announcement that Zambia was seeking a bailout from the IMF for its increasing national debt, which will be negotiated after the general election of August 2016. Then, last week, ethnic violence against Rwandans escalated into looting of shops and houses and rioting in the streets of Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, with Rwandans taking the blame for the ritual killings that have been happening in the past month.</p>

<h2 id="ziec-looks-at-diversifying-zambias-energy-mix">ZIEC looks at diversifying Zambia’s energy mix</h2>

<p>KELVIN KACHINGWE, Lusaka
BARELY a month after CUTS Lusaka hosted a public discussion on the energy crisis, another meeting got under-way in Lusaka last week to look at the same sector.
Just like the CUTS Lusaka-organised forum, the Zambia International Energy Conference (ZIEC) held at Mulungushi International Conference Centre brought together industry experts and like-minded professionals from finance, power, utility, renewable sectors, policy makers, economists and academics to discuss the future of the energy and environmental sectors in Zambia and what the sectors will look like in the next five years.
Held under the theme ‘Diversifying Zambia’s Energy Mix for a Resilient Power Sector’, the objective of the 2016 ZIEC was to accelerate the development and increased utilisation of renewable energy technologies in view of the current power deficit.
Stanbic Bank had partnered with the Ministry of Energy and Water Development in organising the meeting.
In his remarks, the bank’s chief executive officer, Charles Mudiwa, noted that as an institution operating in Zambia, Stanbic recognises that the country and indeed sub-Saharan Africa are endowed with sufficient energy resources to meet the needs of the region, though this sector still remains under-developed.</p>

<p>CHANDA MWENYA, Lusaka
GOVERNMENT has thanked the European Union (EU) for supporting economic growth and poverty alleviation in Zambia.
Minister of Finance Alexander Chikwanda said this during the launch of a photo exhibition on EU-Zambia development partnership that opened at National Museum in Lusaka yesterday.
Mr Chikwanda said Zambia has enjoyed close relations with the EU through the European Development Fund since 1975.
He said the EU has allocated €244 million for improved access to clean, reliable and affordable energy.
Under this component, the EU is upgrading the electricity distribution network and rehabilitation of the Kariba Dam.
Mr Chikwanda said the EU has allocated €110 million towards reducing rural poverty and improvement of livelihoods through conservation agriculture.
