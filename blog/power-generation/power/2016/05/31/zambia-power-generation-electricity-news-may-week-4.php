                <h2 id="off-the-grid---africas-renewable-energy-challenge">Off the grid - Africa’s renewable energy challenge</h2>

<p>JOHANNESBURG – Key issues affecting electricity and energy supply include dependence on diesel power, erratic electricity grids and insufficient generation capacity. If the current power consumption trends continue, it is estimated that by the year 2030, 655 million people in Africa will be without access to power. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 600-million people in Sub-Saharan Africa currently lack access to electricity.In terms of trade and commerce, sourcing reliable power supply and renewable energy is a key priority for businesses in Africa, and the impact of shortfall and erratic supply continues to be felt across a number of sectors.
The CEO of beleaguered Zambia Telecommunications Company (Zamtel) blamed load-shedding, in addition to a weakening economy, for the company’s failure to make profit.</p>

<p>According to the Auditor General’s report, the company has not made any profit since 2012 when it was grabbed from Libya’s Lap Green Networks, who had bought it in 2010 and operated it profitably.
The report also claimed the company recorded a loss of K224 million between 2013 and in 2014.</p>

<p>At the heart of Africa’s power sector problem is the fact that insufficient generation capacity and limited electricity supply results in low access. Together with geographic constraints, these are barriers to the development of the electricity market in Africa says Issam Darwish, Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of IHS Towers Group.</p>

<p>The mobile telecommunications infrastructure provider recently commissioned a report Power Up, Delivering Renewable Energy in Africa, which has found that the continent requires up to US$90 billion to meet its current energy shortfall, that the market for pico-solar units has grown from almost zero in 2009, to 4.5 million in 2014, and, in January 2016, Africa saw its first solar bonds, a securitisation financial product for small scale off-grid solar projects.</p>

<h2 id="ngo-praises-afdb">NGO praises AfDB</h2>

<p>VIOLET MENGO, Lusaka PAN African Climate Justice Alliance secretary-general Mithika Mwenda has commended the African Development Bank for coming up with initiatives aimed at developing the continent.</p>

<p>The AfDB during its annual meetings in Lusaka revealed some initiatives such as the High Fives, the New Deal on Energy and the Agricultural Transformation for Africa, all aimed at position the continent for significant growth.
Mr Mwenda said in an interview at the AfDB annual meetings that Africa has for a long lagged behind in development and time has come to change its story for good.</p>

<p>He said the development of initiatives by the banks gives the civil society an opportunity to engage with the bank, a situation he described a step in the right direction.</p>

<h2 id="ziec-looks-at-diversifying-zambias-energy-mix">ZIEC looks at diversifying Zambia’s energy mix</h2>

<p>Exploiting renewable energy sources and liberalising the energy sector to attract private-sector participation would certainly improve the cost effectiveness of producing electricity on the continent says Mr Darwish.
Therefore, the case for building renewable energy infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa is stronger than ever and positive experiences in lead markets such as South Africa and Kenya highlight successful strategies and best practices, he says.</p>

<p>“In addition, it’s important to note that falling technology costs, ambitious targets, resource abundance, a steady pipeline of high-quality projects, and the support of international donor partners are driving the rollout of renewable power in Africa,” Mr Darwish adds.</p>

<p>Solar and wind energy are especially promising, due to falling costs and resource abundance, he adds, and Africa can also leverage its significant power resources including geothermal power and hydropower.</p>

<p>“From solar-powered hospitals in Lagos to wind farms in Lake Turkana, viable renewable energy solutions are becoming a vital part of the continent’s energy mix. Through a host of off-grid technologies, increased renewable energy capabilities are beginning to provide direct and affordable power to rural and urban regions which have traditionally been beyond the reach of a traditional electricity grid system. In addition, innovative “pay-as-you-go” contracts, affordable technologies such as pico-solar units, and remote utility management software, are all examples of smart alternatives to the conventional grid approach,” says Mr Darwish – ITWeb</p>

<h2 id="60-million-boost-to-zambia-power-grid">$60 million boost to Zambia power grid</h2>

<p>Mining is poised to receive a spinoff benefit from Monday’s announcement that the power grid in Zambia is to be boosted by a $60-million investment. In this latest transaction, Standard Chartered bank has partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to provide a long-term loan to the State-owned Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (Zesco). The loan has been described as one of the largest facilities that USAID has delivered within President Barack Obama’s ‘Power Africa’ partnership since the campaign was launched in 2013.  The loan will finance capital expenditure tor Zesco’s Lusaka transmission and distribution rehabilitation project as well as provide bridge financing to facilitate new connections to the grid. Standard Chartered Zambia CEO Andrew Okai described the latest loan as having both the “longest tenure and largest facility provided to a Zambian parastatal entity to date” and USAID/Zambia mission director Michael Yates said the latest funding would meet a critical need for a quarter of a million Zambians and the economy as a whole. Zesco MD Victor Mundende noted that support from USAID and Standard Chartered had already resulted in more than 15 000 new power connections being established across the organisation’s 39 000 km of power transmission and distribution lines. Standard Chartered corporate and institutional banking division CEO Simon Cooper made the point that Africa accounted for around a sixth of the world’s population, but generated only 4% of its electricity.</p>
