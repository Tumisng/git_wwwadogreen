                <h2 id="four-perish-in-bcl-mine-accident">Four perish in BCL mine accident</h2>

<p>Four BCL miners perished Sunday evening as preliminary information suggests that a rope snapped while a cage was transporting workers at end of shift. The weekend incident has shattered the fatality-prone BCL mine safety priorities which have been questionable as for the past two years (2014/2015) the mine recorded the highest number of fatalities in the sector, with 11 deaths.</p>

<p>Addressing the Botswana Mine Workers Union (BMWU) congress in Tlokweng last year, the union president, Jack Tlhagale blasted the BCL mine for recording the highest casualties out of 17 miners.</p>

<p>In recent time, 11 miners died at BCL mine, two at the Tati Nickel’s Phoenix mine where Moolmans did mining, one miner was run over by a front end loader at Boseto mine, two died from a ground fall at Ghaghoo mine in the CKGR and at the Jwaneng mine a miner died from a slope failure.</p>

<p>Tlhagale had even called on BCL mine management to change their strategies if they wished to turn around the fortunes of the mine currently grappling with collapsed metal prices. The BCL mine has confirmed the fatality and investigations into the real cause of the accident are ongoing.</p>

<h2 id="pangolin-diamonds-to-drill-kimberlite-targets-at-motloutse-diamond-project-botswana">Pangolin Diamonds to Drill Kimberlite Targets at Motloutse Diamond Project, Botswana</h2>

<p>TORONTO, ONTARIO–(Marketwired - May 31, 2016) - Pangolin Diamonds Corp. (TSX VENTURE:PAN) (the “Company” or “Pangolin”) is pleased to provide an update for the Company’s wholly-owned Motloutse Diamond Project (“Motloutse”), located 150 km east of the Orapa Diamond Mine in Botswana. Several aeromagnetic anomalies have been selected for follow-up with soil sampling, ground magnetic and gravity surveys to identify kimberlite drill targets. This program is nearing completion.</p>

<p>The AGA-01 kimberlite target was confirmed on the ground to be associated with a gravity anomaly which coincides with positive kimberlitic indicator minerals. Sub-angular kimberlite indicator garnets with sculptured surfaces, denoting proximity to source, were optically identified from five soil samples collected directly over the gravity anomaly associated with the AGA-01 aeromagnetic anomaly. Both the gravity and soil sampling surveys at AGA-01 are being expanded to cover a larger area.</p>

<p>Additional kimberlite targets are being further developed using detailed gravity surveys expected to be completed by mid-June. Once the gravity results have been interpreted, the drill program will commence and include the additional targets identified. It is anticipated that the percussion drill program will be completed before the end of July 2016.</p>

<p>The Motloutse Diamond Project covers the area where the first diamonds in Botswana were recovered in 1959. It also includes the location where De Beers discovered its first diamonds in Botswana in 1962. The kimberlite source(s) of these diamonds have never been located.</p>

<p>The indicators were recovered at AGA-01 from unscreened 100-litre samples collected on a 50 m x 50 m square grid within a 10 square metre area of a GPS-controlled sample site. The material was dry screened in the field to recover the +0.425-2.0 millimetre size fraction, then transported to Francistown, Botswana and processed through Pangolin’s 1-tph DMS plant. The concentrates were subsequently delivered to an independent mineral specialist in Gaborone, Botswana who examined the concentrate and recovered the indicators.</p>

<h2 id="botswana-water-infrastructure-needs-rehabilitation">Botswana: Water Infrastructure Needs Rehabilitation</h2>

<h5 id="gaborone--the-alarming-water-crises-in-some-areas-is-said-to-be-exacerbated-by-high-water-leakage-and-inadequate-infrastructure-resulting-in-the-water-utilities-corporation-wuc-shutting-down-the-inflow">Gaborone — The alarming water crises in some areas is said to be exacerbated by high water leakage and inadequate infrastructure resulting in the Water Utilities Corporation (WUC) shutting down the inflow.</h5>

<p>This was said by the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources Mr Kgomotso Abi before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) adding that the situation called for rehabilitation of the infrastructure to avoid the leakages.</p>

<p>He however said rehabilitation had already commenced in Mahalapye and WUC was looking to rehabilitate the borehole in Maun to help the water situation in Maun.</p>

<p>Mr Abi denied allegations that the water crisis was caused by low capacities following the transfer of services from Water Affairs noting that WUC had adequate staff capacity because they retained people from water affairs and council.</p>

<p>Responding to questions from MP for Nata Gweta Mr Polson Majaga who asked for an update with regard to underground water drilling, the he stated that work was undergoing as they have teams doing site seeing for underground water drilling to augment the water crises.</p>

<p>Answering a question from MP for Francistown West Mr Ignatius Moswaane who wanted to know how true were the reports that there are people who had dug private dams along the rivers that supply Gaborone dam Mr Abi admitted this was true however said these were small dams that had a capacity less that 400 million cubic litres all combined.</p>
