<p>The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP), a specialized institution of ECOWAS have signed a grant agreement worth $1.9 million to support the Nigeria-Benin Interconnector Reinforcement Project.</p>

<p>The grant will go towards the construction of a 330 kV double circuit high-voltage transmission line from Erukan, Nigeria to Sakete, Benin.</p>

<p>AfDB Acting Vice-President Stefan Nalletamby said: “Energy is one of the most essential requirements for Africa’s development and a key pillar of the Bank’s High 5s vision. The project will allow inclusive economic growth needed to transform the lives and livelihoods of many in the West African region.”</p>

<p>The project will ensure stable integration of the national electricity networks and supply reliable electricity at affordable cost in theECOWAS region.</p>

<h2 id="why-cbn-disbursed-n5546-billion-to-24-power-firms">WHY CBN DISBURSED N55.46 BILLION TO 24 POWER FIRMS</h2>

<p>The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, recently disclosed that the bank disbursed N55.46 billion to 24 power firms as an electricity market stabilisation facility. This was made known during the fourth trance disbursement of the facility in Lagos.</p>

<p>According to Godwin Emefiele, this disbursement, in collaboration with the federal government, is a major milestone for the bank which will help address the challenges of the sector. It will also feature the signing of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Traders (NBET), which will, in turn, signal activation of industry contracts for power generation under a contract based market.</p>

<p>Here are six things happening in the power sector according to Godwin Emefiele:</p>

<p>There are two new entrants into the scheme between the federal government in collaboration with the CBN. These two new entrants were the two distribution companies in Benin and Jos.</p>

<p>The others are eight generating companies that include two independent power projects by Agip/Okpai and Shell and six NIPP plants in Alaoji, Geregu, Ihovbor, Olorunsogo2, Omotosho2 and Sapele2.</p>

<p>The N55.46 billion was disbursed to 24 power firms in the following order — 14 generating companies and the Nigerian Independent Power Project (NIPP) got N35.83 billion, six gas companies received N10.49 billion, three distribution companies received N8.67 billion and a service provider received N459.68 million.</p>

<h2 id="ghana-home-energy-africa-to-develop-solar-pv-project">Ghana: Home Energy Africa to develop solar PV project</h2>

<p>In West Africa, Home Energy Africa, a renewable energy solutions provider, has obtained a $705,000 grant from the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for the development of a solar PV power generation project in Ghana.</p>

<p>Projected to begin construction in 2017, local media reported that this solar project will generate 100MW of power, providing electricity to approximately 80,000 average homes in the country.</p>

<p>The agreement between the two countries was signed by Robert P. Jackson, the US Ambassador to Ghana and Charles Sena Kwadzo Ayenu, CEO of Home Energy Africa.</p>

<p>Inadequate power supply</p>

<p>According to the media, Jackson said the unreliable and inadequate power supply is a major challenge to businesses and entrepreneurs and a constraint to the economy.</p>

<p>He said: “Presently Ghana has 2,450MW of installed capacity. The government of Ghana aspires to double that capacity to 5,000MW this year, including 10% from renewable sources.”</p>

<p>“Through programmes such as Power Africa, the Partnership for Growth and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, we are cooperating with government, the private sector and others to make Ghana’s future brighter, literally brighter.”</p>

<p>Jackson added: “It is exciting to see the great things that can happen when American and Ghanaian companies partner. We are able to bring products and services that benefit Ghanaians throughout this country.”</p>

<p>Technical assistance to Home Energy Africa</p>

<p>Jackson explained that the USTDA grant would go towards providing technical assistance to Home Energy Africa through GreenMax Capital Advisors, an American firm, in finalising the legal and financial details necessary to implement the project.</p>

<p>The assistance includes preparation for power purchase agreement negotiations with the Electricity Company of Ghana, services contracts and financial arrangements.</p>

<p>Commenting on the deal, Ayenu said the signing of the grant was the last barrier that the company has had to cross for work to begin on the project. He added that the firm has also acquired a 30% equity funding agreement for the $150 million project.</p>

<h2 id="rwandas-gas-to-electricity-and-railway-projects-will-make-many-smile">Rwanda’s gas-to-electricity and railway projects will make many smile</h2>

<p>Methane-fired power plant on Lake Kivu to generate clean energy.</p>

<p>IN THE past two weeks Rwanda has made two big announcements, which will have far-reaching implications for cement companies and consumers in the country, as well as for the building and construction sector in a region that has some of the highest cement prices in Africa.</p>

<p>Rwanda has embarked on two big infrastructure projects – first is (the recently launched) methane-fired power plant on Lake Kivu to generate clean energy. The KivuWatt gas-water extraction project is the only one operating in the world, according to ContourGlobal LP, the U.S. company that built the facility.</p>

<p>It is expected to produce 100 megawatts within three years as it extracts gas found in the lake’s deep waters to generate low-carbon emission power, also reducing the risk of a catastrophic release of methane.</p>

<p>In a country that has a current generation capacity of 186 megawatts, and peak demand of 105 megawatts, KivuWatt represents an effective doubling of power available in the country.</p>

<h2 id="home-energy-africa-to-develop-solar-in-ghana">Home Energy Africa To Develop Solar In Ghana</h2>

<p>The agreement between the two countries was signed by Robert P. Jackson, the US Ambassador to Ghana, and Charles Sena Kwadzo Ayenu, CEO of Home Energy Africa.</p>

<p>Home Energy Africa, which specializes in the development and sales of renewable energy products for businesses, governments, and residential homes in Africa, has obtained a $705,000 grant from the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for the development of a solar PV power generation project in Ghana.</p>

<p>Projected to begin construction in 2017, ESI Africa reports that this solar project will generate 100 MW of power, providing electricity to approximately 80,000 average homes in the country.</p>

<p>The agreement between the two countries was signed by Robert P. Jackson, the US Ambassador to Ghana, and Charles Sena Kwadzo Ayenu, CEO of Home Energy Africa.</p>

<p>“Lack of power is a challenge we see across sub-Saharan Africa. Two out of three people in this region lack access to electricity. That hinders business, and it hinders prosperity. We’ve made increasing access to power one of the top priorities for our bilateral relationship. Today’s grant is just one more way we’re bringing together government and the private sector to make Ghana’s future brighter,” said Jackson.</p>
