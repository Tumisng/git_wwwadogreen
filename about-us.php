        	<h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Owing to the success of <strong>tried and tested</strong> recruitment methodology within well-established business hubs to unfamiliar and remote locations, AdoGreen has been able to deliver above expectation on recruitment specs across a spectrum of diverse environments. This has positioned us with the confidence to embrace any <a href="/africa/recruitment-africa-local-specialist-agency.html">recruitment</a> need and challenge within
                <a href="/africa/recruitment-africa-local-specialist-agency.html">Africa</a>. Although there is a primary focus of 4 largely broad sectors, we are <strong>technically and intelligently</strong> equipped with the experience to tackle the most challenging of assignments.
            </p>
        	<h3>Targeted Approach:</h3>
            <p>
                Our approach is refined to not only <strong>identify technically and commercially competent</strong> candidates, but to <strong> understand</strong> our client’s  organisational and personal requirements in line with cultural and departmental fits. We shortlist the very best of potentially  suitable candidates for our clients, and from there, benchmark and select the strongest candidates of that final shortlist to  offer the most superior selection choice. By this, <strong>we strategically limit</strong> the number of applications submitted to our clients 
                to save time and money for our clients within the recruitment process. Depending on the position and request of clients, our  average CV submission is <strong>3 CVs per job spec</strong>.

            <h3>Integrity:</h3>
            <p>
                Our client’s success means our success and therefore it is of <strong>paramount importance </strong>to us to ensure that none of our clients ever  encounters a bad hiring experience, not only beyond initial appointment but throughout our candidate’s career with our client as well. To ensure this, <strong>we do not take shortcuts</strong> on candidate profiling and interviewing, reference checks and paperwork required. Only the most  highly qualified and genuinely interested candidates are recommended for CV submission, whereby candidate motives also need to  align with our client’s best interests to ensure longevity and a successful hiring experience long term. <strong>Experience </strong>has sharpened  our ability to identify risk candidates quickly, and therefore we can safely and confidently offer this expertise to our clients,  knowing that we do not just fill a spec, but offer long term peace of mind.
