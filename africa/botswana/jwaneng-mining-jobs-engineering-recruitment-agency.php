            <h3>Jwaneng (Botswana) Richest Diamond Mine</h3>
                <p>Situated in the Naledi River Valley of the Kalahari in the Southern District of Botswana is the town of Jwaneng. 
                    It is about 120 km west of Gaborone. 
                    Although Jwaneng is inside the Southern District it is not part of this 
                    district but rather a separate district with its own Town Council.</p><br>
                <p>Jwaneng is home to the richest diamond mine in the world Jwaneng Diamond mine in regards to Gem-Quality Diamonds, 
                    carries little resemblance to the meaning of its name “a place of small stones” (Setswana). The pipe was discovered 
                    in the Valley of the Stars “Naledi River Valley” in 1972. Jwaneng Diamond Mine is a partnership between the Botswana 
                    government and the De Beers group, and began operations in 1982 when it was opened by the then President of Botswana, 
                    His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire. It is an open pit mine. When Jwaneng started as a town it was a closed town and 
                    you had to have permission from the owners Debswana to live there.</p><br>
                <p>The mine employs over 2100 people and operates its own Airport and Hospital. This mine is also the first in Botswana 
                    to receive its ISO 14001 certificate for environmental compliance, and it comes with no surprise that it is known for 
                    its outstanding safety record nationally and internationally.</p><br>
                <p>Jwaneng is home to the Jwana Game Park and is host to the threatened Lappet-Faced Vulture.</p><br>
