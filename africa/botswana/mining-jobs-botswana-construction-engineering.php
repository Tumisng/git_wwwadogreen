                Mining has dominated the national economy of Botswana for many years now. Diamonds have been the leading commodity mined, and exported from Botswana. Diamond mining on a large scale started around 25 years ago. Botswana soon became the leading exporter of diamonds by value in the world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Botswana has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and is generally easy to do business in. This has made Botswana very attractive for investment. Botswana has recently had problems in the power generation sector and as soon as their new projects are online and producing electricity Botswana would become a country of choice for many foreign investment companies. Botswana is also considered the country with the lowest corruption in Africa as supposed to its neighbour South Africa who has in 2015 been crowned as the most corrupt country in Africa.

            <h4>Exploration</h4>
            <p>
                Large scale exploration has been going in Botswana over the last few years, and should the commodity prices increase substantially we will see a rise in new projects getting off the ground.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>2015 Commodity Lows</h4>
            <p>
                Botswana will have a lot of projects starting as soon as the commodity prices rise again. The quick fall of prices earlier in 2015 saw many projects come to halt and even some mining companies close down in Botswana. The falling price of diamonds has had has had a tremdous negative effect on the economy which was already struggling with a very high workless force.
