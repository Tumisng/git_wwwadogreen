                With around 150 000 people (according to the 2011 census), Francistown is the second largest city in Botswana. Being on one of the main business travelling routes in Botswana, it is often called “Capital of the North”. Being close to two borders <a href="/africa/zambia/zambia-mining-jobs-engineering-construction-recruitment.php">Zambia</a> and Zimbabwe, this city is a major transport hub. A railway line links Harare (Zimbabwe) with Francistown via Bulawayo. The same line runs south to Lobatse and Gaborone.
