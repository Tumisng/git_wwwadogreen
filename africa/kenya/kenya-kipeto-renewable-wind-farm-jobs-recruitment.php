            <h2>Overview - Kenya's Power Generation Industry</h2>
            <p>
                Most of Kenyaâ€™s electricity is produced by hydroelectric stations. Many of these hydroelectric plants are along the upper Tana River, and Turkwel Gorge Dam. There is a petroleum-fired plant at the coast. Geothermal plants are near Nairobi. Electricity is also imported from Uganda and in the near future they will also import electricity from Ethiopia. Kenya has a state owned power generation company called Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen). The Kenya Power Company handles the generation of electricity and Kenya Power handles the transmission and distribution system.
