            <h2>Mining Engineering Construction Industry Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Namibia gained independence on 21 March 1990 and its capital is Windhoek. It is part of SADEC (Southern African Development Community) and AU (African Union). Namibia has a population of 2.1 million people and a stable multi-party parliamentary democracy with local, regional and national elections held regularly. Their president for 15 years after independence was Sam Nujoma who has given over to Hifikepunye Pohamba in 2005. The SWAPO party has been dominant since its independence. Namibiaâ€™s currency is closely linked to the South African Rand and this means that the economy goes up and down with South Africa.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Namibia was ranked the tenth most stable jurisdiction in the world by the Fraser Institute 2010-2011). It has enjoyed great success since its independence and has had sound economic management up to date. Although the per capita income places Namibia in the WBG (World Bank Group) in the upper-middle income group the average income on ground level is completely different with Namibia being one of the most unequal wealth distribution countries in the world today.

            <p>
                Namibia has a stable mining jurisdiction. It is also among the top 10 producers of diamonds in the world and is in the top five uranium producers in the world. Other industries benefitting from the strong mining industry would be engineering, supply chain and various others..
